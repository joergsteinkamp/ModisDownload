ModisDownload version 2.0
==========================

This modules provides an interface to download MODIS satellite data.

So far this module was only run on Debian linux. However, it should
run on all other *nix systems as well.

For debugging network issues, I recommend to include
'use LWP::ConsoleLogger::Everywhere ();'
after 'use WebService::MODIS;', which helped me a lot to debug the authentication issues I experienced.
